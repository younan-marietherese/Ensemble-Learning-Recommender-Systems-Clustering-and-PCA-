# Ensemble Learning, Recommender Systems, Clustering, and PCA

This project covers multiple core areas of machine learning, including **Ensemble Learning (AdaBoost)**, **Recommender Systems**, **Clustering**, and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. Each section demonstrates how these techniques can be applied to different types of data and tasks, from boosting weak classifiers to reducing dimensionality in data.

## Project Overview
This notebook explores four key machine learning techniques:
1. **Ensemble Learning (AdaBoost)**: A powerful technique that combines weak learners to form a stronger classifier, improving model accuracy.
2. **Recommender Systems**: Systems designed to suggest items to users based on their preferences, commonly used in e-commerce and content streaming services.
3. **Clustering**: A technique for grouping similar data points together, useful for exploratory data analysis and pattern recognition.
4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A dimensionality reduction technique that projects high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving variance.

Each section includes exercises that demonstrate the implementation and evaluation of these models, highlighting their applications in real-world scenarios.

## Objectives
- Implement and evaluate an **AdaBoost** classifier for boosting weak learners.
- Build a **Recommender System** to predict user preferences based on collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
- Perform **Clustering** using algorithms such as K-Means to group similar data points.
- Apply **PCA** to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining important information.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
- **Pandas/Numpy**: For handling datasets and performing matrix operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms such as AdaBoost, clustering, and PCA.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting results.
- **Surprise Library**: For building collaborative filtering recommender systems (if used).

## Key Sections

### 1. Ensemble Learning with AdaBoost
**AdaBoost** is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a more accurate model. This section covers:
- Training weak learners (e.g., decision stumps).
- Combining weak learners to create a strong classifier.
- Evaluating the performance of the AdaBoost model using accuracy and other metrics.

### 2. Recommender Systems
This section focuses on building a **Recommender System**, which suggests items (e.g., movies, products) to users based on their preferences. Techniques covered may include:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Making recommendations based on user-item interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommending items based on item features or user preferences.

### 3. Clustering
Clustering involves grouping similar data points together. In this section, the **K-Means** algorithm is applied to cluster the dataset into distinct groups. The steps include:
- Choosing the number of clusters.
- Training the K-Means model and analyzing the resulting clusters.
- Visualizing the clusters using 2D or 3D plots.

### 4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**PCA** is a dimensionality reduction technique that projects data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible. This section covers:
- Applying PCA to high-dimensional datasets.
- Reducing the number of features in the dataset.
- Visualizing the explained variance and the transformed data.
